Welcome to StockWatch the Big Bank Portfolio Tracker
================================

Big Banks Wealth Management program has a created a tool to allow to track your stock portfolio or stocks that are of interest.

Simply select the stocks you want to 'Follow' and 'Unfollow' the stocks you don't.
================================

 I wanted to create a simple to use application to allow users to do what they would be doing 80/90% of the time.
 
 I don't think I made any trade offs 
 
 With more time I would have each stock being tracked expandable showing more information.
 -Allow users to have favouties
 -Drag and drop to reorder
 -Reorder the stocks and alphabetically
 -Search function with users stocks
 -Explore the API endpoints more to give user more meaningful data.
 -Allow user to display which data they wanted to follow.
 
 As I built it in node you will need to install npm -'npm install node' and fetch -'npm install fetch'.
